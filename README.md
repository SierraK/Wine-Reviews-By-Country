## Introductory  
We are doing a project in python to perform MapReduce functions on Wine Reviews. The functions we will be performing are to find the sum, count, minimum, and maximum.

## Data Source
We have taken a dataset of Wine Reviews which has 51MB. The variety of the dataset is structured. The file extension is .csv which means it is an excel file.  The dataset provides information on the country the wine is from, the number of points that the wine was rated, and the price of the wine.

| US      | This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from   Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a   compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins   and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start   to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy   2022â€“2030. | Martha's Vineyard | 96     | 235   | California | Napa Valley | Napa     | Cabernet Sauvignon | Heitz  |
